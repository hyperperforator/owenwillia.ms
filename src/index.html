    <h2 class="page-heading">About Owen</h2>
    <p>I've worn a ton of different hats: writer, developer, infrastructure engineer and marketer. Over the years I've crafted the ability to build my own products and communicate effectively, obsessing about new ideas in my spare time and learning in every spare moment (who needs sleep?).</p>

    <p>Recently I worked as <a href="http://thenextweb.com/author/owilliams">Editor at The Next Web</a>, with my posts reaching more than 1 million unique viewers each month and I'm now the Director of Digital at <a href="http://vanmoof.com">VanMoof in Amsterdam to help them grow their online business.</a></p>

    <p>I'm always available for freelance writing, with my recent clients including Intercom, IKEA/Space10, DigitalOcean, Emojipedia, The Next Web, The Verge and HP.</p>

    <p>In my spare time I've also built a weekly technology newsletter called <a href="http://char.gd">Charged</a> that's delivered to 10,000 people, <a href="http://podcast.char.gd">started a podcast</a> that over 110,000 people have listened to and co-founded a digital design studio called <a href="http://theapartment.co">The Apartment</a> that builds interactive experiences in Amsterdam.</p>

    <p>I'm also an avid developer, and have used a lot of cool tech like Javascript, Node.js, Gulp, Grunt, PHP, Heroku and Amazon Web Services – you name it – but I'm really great at explaining complex technical topics to people, and using those skills to reach people across industries regardless of background.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to chat, work with me, meet up or just say hi, I'd love to hear from you: <strong><a href="mailto:owen@char.gd">get in touch.</a></strong></p>
