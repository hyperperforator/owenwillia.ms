    <h2 class="page-heading">Hi, I'm Owen!</h2>
    <p>I'm a technologist based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands with skills across the board. I've been a infrastructure engineer, web developer, product manager <i>and</i> full-time writer, so I know how to take complex topics then distill them into something everyone can understand and enjoy reading – without the jargon. </p>

    <p>Every week I put that into practice with my newsletter, <a href="https://char.gd">Charged,</a> which goes out to 15,000 people at every company in the industry that matters and continues to grow rapidly – and soon we'll be launching a platform for Charged that takes it even further.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for a freelance writer, help with your marketing and positioning or general media advice, I can help. If it's PR love you need, my inbox is full of thousands of crappy PR requests every day – so I know what ticks the boxes and what doesn't.</p>

    <p>My <a href="/portfolio">recent clients</a> include Intercom, Hubspot, Clearbit, IKEA, Space10, DigitalOcean, Emojipedia, The Next Web, The Verge and HP. I'm looking for new people to work with all the time, so if you need a blog post, content marketing or anything else – I can code too – let's talk.</p>

    <p>In early 2018 I'm available for freelance writing or development work. Just <strong><a href="mailto:owen@char.gd">get in touch</a></strong> and let me know what you're working on!</p>
    <a href="mailto:owen@char.gd" class="btn home-btn">Hire me!</a>
