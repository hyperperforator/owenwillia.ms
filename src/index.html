    <p>I'm a technologist based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands with skills across the board. I've been a infrastructure engineer, web developer, product manager <i>and</i> full-time writer, so I know how to take complex topics then distill them into something everyone can understand and enjoy reading – without the jargon.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for a freelance writer, help with your marketing and positioning or general media advice, I can help. If it's PR love you need, my inbox is full of thousands of crappy PR requests every day – so I know what ticks the boxes and what doesn't.</p>

    <p>My <a href="/portfolio">recent clients</a> include Intercom, IKEA/Space10, Offscreen Magazine, DigitalOcean, Emojipedia, The Next Web, Atomic, The Verge and HP. I'm looking for new people to work with, so if you need a blog post, content marketing or anything else – I can code too – let's talk.</p>

    <p>I am available for freelance writing or development work right now! Just <strong><a href="mailto:owen@char.gd">get in touch.</a></strong></p>
