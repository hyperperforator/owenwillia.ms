In August I found myself transferring between two jobs, with a few weeks off, so Fem and I decided we'd take a little bit of a spontaneous trip to Annecy, France, to satisfy our cravings for being in the mountains again.

We flew off to Geneva, picked up a cheap rental car (read: terrible Renault piece of crap) and found a lovely Airbnb close to the lake, but out in the nature.

Geneva is just an hour from Amsterdam by plane, and under ‚Ç¨100, but it feels like a world away.

Annecy is an area where there's basically every outdoor sport you can imagine in a single place. You can waterski, hike, paraglide, mountain climb, cycle, mountain bike and everything else you're able to come up with... all in a single city.

We were mostly in the area to hike, so every day was jam-packed with a different hike. On the very first day we scaled Mont Veyrier, which is 1,291m.

One tiny spot we found was after a long drive to the top of a mountain where there was a paragliding launch station. These people were launching one after another into the sky, without breaking a sweat.

Eventually, it just kinda looked like multi-color confetti floating around.

I thought the first day was pretty steep, but it got even crazier on day two, when we drove to Chamonix and scaled L'Index at a solid 2,595 (though that had a chairlift about a third of the way!).

L'Index ‚Äì and the Alps ‚Äì were beautiful, but perhaps a stark reminder of climate change. There are six glaciers up there, all of them looking in an incredibly sad, receded state. It's kinda humbling just how much of a mark of human decimation they are.

Oh, and the other thing about Chamonix? The chair lifts are crazy expensive ‚Äì it was ‚Ç¨68 return for the two of us... just to go for a hike. Insane, given the prices in the winter when you can actually ski are the same.

On the way back from Chamonix, we found a 'Canyon walk' which was built by a French man in the 1800's who discovered this incredible area and wanted to share it with the world ‚Äì really cute, and a ton of work for them to maintain.

Our second-to-last day was spent conquering the highest peak in Annecy, a mountain called La Tournette, at a staggering 2,351. The hike involved an increase in elevation of 2,351m, and took about six hours bottom to top.

This was probably one of the most stunning ‚Äì and exhausting ‚Äì hikes I've ever done, but it was worth it at the top. I recorded my heart rate with Apple Watch, and it was basically a strenous walk for a solid four hours, looking at the graph.

It's an exhausting battle uphill, especially in the 30-degree heat on the day we attempted it, since there's very little shade on that side of the mountain.

After the trip down I basically couldn't walk for a while ‚Äì it was incredibly steep and loose, so brutal on the knees and ankles.

Our adorable house in Annecy was up the hill in a tiny commune called Saint Eustache ‚Äì it's certainly an area you wouldn't be able to get around in without a car, but Airbnb made it incredibly cheap to stay in the area, even though it's so touristic.

We ended each long day of hiking with a dip in the lake, since it was over 30 degrees reliably. Lake Annecy is seriously warm and refreshing after a solid six hours of walking!

If you ever get the chance to head to Annecy, I highly recommend it. Spend a week there, don't waste your time in the tourist areas... and climb some mountains!

It's refreshing for the soul, especially when you live somewhere as flat as Amsterdam. üòè
